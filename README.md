#Fusion360 Posts

Above is the list of post processors that I use on a daily basis
These post processors have a lot of comments , I built these posts to help my operators to have a better information of the setup and program
Not everyone can make sense of G Codes.
The comments help / warn / notify the operators mostly to avoid crashes.

The post processors have been changed only cosmetically(if that is a word) , no movements code have been added or removed , if the comments
are removed it is pretty much the exact movement codes as a stock post would do.

Setup sheets are a separate document to be maintained , so to an extent these posts contain some of the information as setup sheets.

Post Processors for :

DMG Mori NLX 2500 / 700

Haas ST20Y

Haas VF 3AX Mills

Siemens 808D Milling
