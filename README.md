My Fusion Post Processor Edits here !

Here is my post processor for Haas 3Axis VMC has the following features
1. Shows Date and Time at Start of the Program
2. Got Rid of the Fanuc Style Program Number , now text strings are program number/name gives a nice view on control
3. Does not posts any Work Offset code G54/55/56/57... instead gives a good line saying "Specify Offset Here"
4. Shows Tool List with Max Z Depth of Each tool, help verify tool stickout and any unwanted Z Plunges.
5. Each Operation is well formatted into sections making the program look pretty.
6. Has some Automation options of DPRNT over TCP , can be modified to suit needs.
